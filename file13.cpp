#define print(s) std::cout << s << std::endl //I know, I know. But it's one line and won't break anything.

// I thought about using lambdas for print to be nice but it's no bueno, and I'm not using namespace std and I'm not using << explicitly. It's so ugly. now I'm an outlaw using preprocessor commands on a whim. if you don't like it you're going to need to pry my print() function from my cold, dead hands.//auto print = [](std::string s){std::cout << s << std::endl;}; //I know 4 ways to do this now - typedef, define, using, and lambdas. no preprocessor stuff outside of ifndef. I wanted to template the lambda because I want to be able to print anything - but of course the lambda works using function pointers, and templates make multiple functions based on the use case and thus there are multiple function pointers - so of course it doesn't work... But templated lambdas will be introduced in C++20! Excited for this - should be out this month I think - but for now, I'm breaking the law and abusing the preprocessor.
